Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design ,development and maintainance of software .It is importance as it tests the software applications and enavles them to run effectively through constant maintainance .It also works to make life easier for engineers .

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of the softaware
Testing of the software 
Execution

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning -This is where the plan is effectively set up on how and what needs to be done .
Design -The process of designing the best software that fits the needs of the client.
Development -Working on the software.
Testing -Running a number of tests to see if it makes sense.
Deployment -Putting the software into play .

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall model is a methodology that follows a specific described sequence while the Agile model is more flexible and adaptable with different features .The Waterfall model is used in complex situations that are straight forward and does not need addotional changes .

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer -This individuals roles is to plan ,design and develop the software.He or she also tests and deploys the spftware for its use .
Quality Assuarance engineer-Provides monitoring process on how the software works .He or she can also collect feedback on the impact of the software ,what changes can be done to effectively serve the client .
Project Manager -Oversights the whole teamby providing management solutions ,leading teams into discussions and brain storming sessions to provide the best software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constraints-Limited time to conduct the software changes.Develop a plan that guides on time management.
Resources-Lack of resources to manage and develop the software -Constant resource mobilization and budgeting. 
Customer demands - Demands vary with each customer where some have more unrealistic demands .-The software developer needs to have a session with the customer to undertand each of the demands and have an understanding .
Advanced technology-Technology is gradualy changing.Need to gradually improve systems to suit the advanced changes over time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing -Enables testing of specific unit to give an uotline of how the software will work .This enables the quality assuarance team to have first hand feedback on how the software works.
Intergration -Interagrates the software to existing sysyems to enable the team know what works best.
System -Working out the system if it works and gives results 
Acceptance -This is where the software reaches the acceptance stage after testing and is ready to  used

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Propmpt engineering is the science of creating different prompts with AI systems to enable you have clear and consice answerrs.It enables you have clear responses to each of the questions asked .

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt 
Vague Propmt -Where is Nairobi what can i do once i am there .
Clear Propmt -As a visitor where is Nairobi located and where are some of the interesting places to visit as a tourist.
